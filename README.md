##Barbell Exercise Tracker

Barbell Exercise Tracker is a machine learning-powered fitness tool that analyzes wristwatch sensor data to track repetitions, monitor performance, and provide intelligent feedback on when to increase or adjust weight. Designed for strength training enthusiasts, this project helps optimize workouts with data-driven insights.
Features:

    Rep Counting – Automatically detects and counts repetitions.
    Weight Suggestions – Analyzes performance and recommends weight adjustments.
    Performance Tracking – Logs workout history for progress analysis.
    Machine Learning Integration – Uses ML models to improve accuracy and provide personalized feedback.
    Built with Python – Leverages powerful libraries for data processing and model training.

How It Works:

    Collects motion data from a wristwatch.
    Processes data to detect repetitions and movement patterns.
    Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze performance trends.
    Provides real-time feedback and weight recommendations.

This project is open to improvements and contributions.
